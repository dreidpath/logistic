# logistic
A shiny package under development to help students understand logistic regression.

It often seems that beginners get so caught up in the 'doing' of data analysis that they fail to understand
the data or the particular analysis that they are conducting.

The intention is to develop a shinyApp that will allow students to play with and understand the underlying
ideas of logistic regression (a) without fussing about the doing, and (b) without a needing a degree in 
statistics.
